## Branch Information

**Branch Name:** `feature/2026-02-24_phase-3.2-frontend-lobby-leaderboard`
**Created From:** `develop` (commit f25c411)
**Created:** 2026-02-24 00:50 GMT+13
**Purpose:** Implement Phase 3.2 - Frontend Development (Tournament Lobby + Leaderboard)

## Context: Why Phase 3.2 After Phase 3.3?

### Original Plan
The original project plan (TASK-BOARD.md) listed phases in this order:
1. Phase 3.1 - Architecture (completed, superseded by DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Phase 3.2 - Frontend** (planned first)
3. **Phase 3.3 - Backend** (planned second)

### Actual Execution Order
We executed in a different order for strategic reasons:
1. ✅ **Phase 3.3 - Backend** (completed first, deployed as v0.1.0)
2. → **Phase 3.2 - Frontend** (now starting)

### Rationale for Change
**Why backend first:**
- Backend API needed to be stable and production-ready first
- Full TypeScript/TypeORM conversion was foundational work
- Comprehensive unit testing required before frontend integration
- Frontend could then be built against a stable, tested API

**Benefits of this approach:**
- ✅ Backend API is now production-ready (v0.1.0)
- ✅ 43 unit tests ensure API stability (93.71% coverage)
- ✅ Complete API documentation available
- ✅ Frontend can develop against confident, tested endpoints

## Phase 3.2 Work Scope

### Features to Build

#### 1. Tournament Lobby UI
**Component:** Tournament list and registration interface
**Functionality:**
- Display list of available tournaments
- Show tournament details (name, buy-in, entry fee, max players, scheduled time)
- Filter/search tournaments by status
- Register for tournaments (authenticated users)
- Unregister from tournaments
- Display player count and available seats

**API Integration:**
- GET /api/tournaments - List all tournaments
- GET /api/tournaments/:id - Get tournament details
- POST /api/tournaments/:id/register - Register for tournament
- DELETE /api/tournaments/:id/unregister - Unregister from tournament

#### 2. Leaderboard UI
**Component:** Global rankings and player statistics
**Functionality:**
- Display global leaderboard (top players by winnings)
- Show player statistics:
  - Tournaments played
  - Tournament wins
  - Average finish position
  - Total winnings
- Pagination for leaderboard
- Individual player profile view

**API Integration:**
- GET /api/leaderboard - Global rankings
- GET /api/leaderboard/:user_id - Player stats

#### 3. Authentication UI (Optional Enhancement)
**Component:** Login/register forms
**Functionality:**
- User registration form
- User login form
- JWT token management
- Authenticated state handling

**API Integration:**
- POST /api/auth/register - User registration
- POST /api/auth/login - User authentication

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Stack (To Be Decided)
**Recommended:**
- React 18+ (modern hooks, concurrent features)
- TypeScript (type safety matching backend)
- Vite or Create React App (build tooling)
- TailwindCSS or Material-UI (styling)
- React Router (navigation)
- Axios or Fetch API (HTTP client)
- React Query (API state management)

### Backend API Available
**Version:** v0.1.0 (deployed to production)
**Development URL:** http://localhost:5000
**Production URL:** (to be determined)
**Documentation:** docs/documentation/API-REFERENCE.md
**Test Coverage:** 93.71% routes, 43/43 tests passing

### Development Approach
1. Set up React project structure
2. Configure API client (axios/fetch)
3. Build component library (reusable UI components)
4. Implement tournament lobby page
5. Implement leaderboard page
6. Add routing and navigation
7. Implement authentication flow
8. Test with local backend API
9. Deploy frontend
