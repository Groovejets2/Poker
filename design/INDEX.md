## Notes on Design Documents

- **These are tactical and evolving** — they change as work progresses
- **Not immutable like specifications/** — specs lock us in; design guides us
- **Updated frequently** — expect TASK-BOARD.md to update every work session
- **Informal review** — Jon may request changes, but no formal "approval" cycle
- **Reference specifications/** for architecture/rules that design documents must respect
